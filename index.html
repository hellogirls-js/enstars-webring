      <h1>Welcome to the Webring!</h1>
      <p>Brought to my attention by a Retrospring anon, I decided to bring this nostalgic concept to life! It was actually a quick task, designing it was the hardest part. Let's do our part to have fun and create a playful online experience again!</p>
      <p>Read the following before submitting a website to the webring.</p>
      <h2>What is a Webring?</h2>
      <p>A webring is a collection of websites that all revolve around a similar subject or specific theme. They are all linked together in a circular structure and are easily navigatable via a navigation box added to the top of each site involved. The moderator of the webring, or Ringmaster, is in charge of approving and adding each site to the webring.</p>
      <p>This webring is based on Ensemble Stars, so all of the websites involved revolve around the game.</p>
      <h2>What are the rules for this webring?</h2>
      <h3>Content rules</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span>All sites involved must be inspired by Ensemble Stars.</span></li>
        <li><span>No NSFW or graphic content, this webring is for all ages.</span> </li>
        <li><span>No hateful or insensitive content target towards any particular racial group, sexuality, gender, nationality, disability, etc.</span></li>
        <li><span>No sites promoting character hate either, keep this as a positive zone.</span></li>
        <li><span>For the sake of everyone's comfort <strong>please refrain from including ships</strong>.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Submission rules</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span>The submitted sites must be handcrafted with love. Please don't submit pages from already existing sites such as Twitter, Tumblr, Carrd, or Rentry.</span></li>
        <li><span>Only single page websites please. If a site has multiple pages, only the homepage will be included in the webring cycle.</span></li>
        <li><span>Preferably, the website should be written in simple HTML + CSS. However, you're free to play with frameworks as long as the webring script is compatible with your site.</span></li>
        <li><span>Please submit the full URL for the website, no shortened URLs such as bit.ly or other URL shorteners.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Overall, just be respectful. As long as the website is created with love then it will most likely comply with these rules.</p>
      <h2>"I want to make a site, but I'm not confident in my coding skills."</h2>
      <p>That's okay! Don't worry about making a shitty website, this webring will accept sites made by people of all experience levels.</p>
      <h2>"Is there a deadline to submit a site?"</h2>
      <p>Nope! Take your time, this webring isn't going anywhere.</p>
      <h2>"I finished my website! How do I add it to the Webring?"</h2>
      <p>Awesome! Here are some steps on how to host your website and submit it to the webring:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><div>Please add this piece of code in the <span class="code-text">head</span> tag of the page you're submitting:
        <pre>
          <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hellogirls-js/enstars-webring/src/webring.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
          Don't worry if nothing happens when you first add the script, the webring widget will appear once your site is added to the ring.</div></li>
        <li><span>Find a place to host your site. I recommend <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for simple websites, although you can find other places to host if you search on Google.</span></li>
        <li><span>Once hosted, send your site to the Ringmaster by filling out <a href="https://forms.gle/1DCz3XzNDE3NeQc47">this form</a>.</span></li>
        <li><span>If approved, the Ringmaster will add your site to the webring and you will be contacted.</span></li>
        <li><span>Congrats! You can now share your site with your friends :)</span></li>
      </ol>
